Hi there,

This is a small development about how insert massive data in a Database (MySQL) using Parallelism in Java with "Executors".

Technical Specs :

- Access to DB should be through JPA. -> OK
- For DB type, you can select between (MySql or MongoDB) -> MySQL
- Provide a web interface for uploading files and inquire about results "using filename" following web applications 3 tier architecture. Spring Batch is not allowed. - JPA / EJB / JSF
- Provide a web interface for inquire about results "using filename" .Â· -> OK
- We expect you to generate sample data set to use it during development  -> OK
- We expect the system to display a summary report for each file after process is finished; summary may contain process duration, number of imported deals and number of invalid records.  -> OK
- We expect you to generate sample data set to use it during development.  -> OK

Deliverables:

- Workable deployment including sample file.
- Deployment steps including sample data of 100K records, contains all invalid/valid records that the system handles.
- Maven or Gradle project is required for full source code.
- Proper error/exception handling.
